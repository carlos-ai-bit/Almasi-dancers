<h1>ALMASI DANCERS</h1>
<p>Since the completion of his Masters in Physical Theatre program at Dell’ Arte School of Physical Theatre California, Tafadzwa has been immersing himself in the Zimbabwean dramatic arts scene. He has been teaching physical theatre at AfriKera Dance Theatre school and Zimbabwe Theatre Academy. At HIFA 2018 he performed in ‘We Must Transcend’ by AfriKera Dance Theatre ( choreographed by Peter Lenso and Macintosh Jerahuni), and ‘Mami Wata’, a collaboration between Belgium based Dunia Dance Theatre and AfriKera Dance Theatre (choreographed by Harold George). He also directed a staged reading of ‘Master’s Shoe’ by Gideon Jeph Wabvuta as part of the Almasi African Playwrights Conference at HIFA 2018. Tafadzwa is currently developing and fundraising for his physical theatre production ‘Chirorodziva’, which is an investigative journey into the world of ritual theatre for the healing of racial and political trauma</p>
